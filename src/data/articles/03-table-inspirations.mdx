## A renovation project would best describe the difference between the two fields explicitly.

For instance, a renovation of any space might include dismantling of a certain portion while keeping the basic structure intact. It might include re-running of electrical wires, re-piping for change of plumbing, introduction of ventilation system etc. The final outcome would still demand substantial amount of styling and decor services; maintaining both functionality as well as aesthetic appeal would be of utmost value. This is exactly how interior architects function.
