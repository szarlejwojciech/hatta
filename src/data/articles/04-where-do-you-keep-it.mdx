## Interior designers on the other hand, usually take up a project after the structure is built.

They handle the decor, theme, color scheme, artwork, furniture and fixtures, upholstery etc. They would be in a position to suggest the best wallpapers, rugs and furniture to suit the theme of the space and ensure comfort.

Interior designers have a specific horizon to explore in residential and work spaces, however, projects like adaptive reuse, exhibition design, set design and the like require the expertise of an interior architect. One can say that interior design is the art and interior architecture is the art and science of design.
